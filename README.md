# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary:**

##### Overall Objective 
We set out to design a heart disease risk predictor that makes it simpler for people to assess their potential risk without needing frequent, in-person medical visits. Our work included researching existing risk estimator tools, conducting heuristic evaluations, and developing personas and scenarios based on real-world contexts.

##### Big-Picture Insights:
- Competitor research revealed that cluttered interfaces, specialized medical jargon, and no guidance on biometrics reduce usability and trust.
- Heuristic evaluations highlighted the need for clear instructions, error prevention, and more intuitive layouts.
- Persona and scenario work showed that seniors, busy professionals, and other user groups require different forms of guidance and reassurance.

##### What We Learned:
- Even strong medical or technical foundations must be communicated in a way that non-experts understand.
-Short definitions and tooltips can bridge the knowledge gap.
-Considering data biases and ensuring the product can be adapted or updated is critical to addressing a wide range of user needs.
- Ongoing user feedback and iterative testing are crucial for refining the design and ensuring it meets the needs of diverse demographics

These findings serve as a guiding framework for subsequent phases, where user insights and competitor benchmarks will continue shaping the design and validation of our heart disease risk predictor.

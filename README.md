# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary:**

##### Overall Objective 
We set out to design a heart disease risk predictor that makes it simpler for people to assess their potential risk without needing frequent, in-person medical visits. Our work included researching existing risk estimator tools, conducting heuristic evaluations, and developing personas and scenarios based on real-world contexts.

##### Big-Picture Insights:
- Competitor research revealed that cluttered interfaces, specialized medical jargon, and no guidance on biometrics reduce usability and trust.
- Heuristic evaluations highlighted the need for clear instructions, error prevention, and more intuitive layouts.
- Persona and scenario work showed that seniors, busy professionals, and other user groups require different forms of guidance and reassurance.

##### What We Learned:
- Even strong medical or technical foundations must be communicated in a way that non-experts understand.
- Short definitions and tooltips can bridge the knowledge gap.
- Considering data biases and ensuring the product can be adapted or updated is critical to addressing a wide range of user needs.
- Ongoing user feedback and iterative testing are crucial for refining the design and ensuring it meets the needs of diverse demographics

These findings serve as a guiding framework for subsequent phases, where user insights and competitor benchmarks will continue shaping the design and validation of our heart disease risk predictor.

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

**Contributions**

* **[Numan Khan](https://usabilityengineering.github.io/portfolio-numan-7/)** - Analysis, Wireframes, Refining Wireframes after Feedback
* **[Tony Ferriera](https://usabilityengineering.github.io/portfolio-Tony-Ton3/)** - Initial Sketches, Wireframes, Identify improvements after Feedback
* **[Raghav Chandna](https://usabilityengineering.github.io/portfolio-RC-15-coder/)** - Analysis, Wireframes, Refining Wireframes after Feedback

**Executive Summary**

In this sprint, our main goal was to gather feedback and refine our design based on that feedback. Evaluators in our cognitive walkthroughs generally found the website clear and easy to navigate, but identified specific problems with unclear biometric data inputs. Informal feedback from the Software Engineering students showed that users prioritize transparency regarding an AI modelâ€™s training data, accuracy, and risk calculation methodology. Therefore, our immediate focus will be clarifying biometric input instructions and providing detailed transparency about the AI model to enhance user trust and usability.

* **[Tony Ferriera](https://usabilityengineering.github.io/portfolio-Tony-Ton3/)** - Initial Sketches, Wireframe Design, Identify improvements after Feedback, Wireframe Prototyping, User Test Judge/Participant
* **[Raghav Chandna](https://usabilityengineering.github.io/portfolio-RC-15-coder/)** - Analysis, Wireframe Design, Refining Wireframes after Feedback, Wireframe Prototyping, User Test Judge/Participant

**Executive Summary**

This sprint focused on evaluating our wireframe prototype through a **user study** involving **six** participants. The study aimed to gather both **qualitative** and **quantitative** data to inform design improvements.

**Key Takeaways**:
  - The user study provided valuable insights into the prototype's usability.
  - We obtained both qualitative and quantitative data.
  - The prototype demonstrates good overall usability, with some areas needing improvement.
  - Primary areas for improvement include:
    - Improving the clarity and content of the "About" (Now Model) page, particularly regarding the AI model.
    - Reconsidering the labeling of Navbar titles.
  
  This data will be used to drive design iterations and improve the final product.

Name: John

Age: 58 year old male 

Location: San Antonio, Texas

Status: Construction Manager at Numan Does Construction With Tony Inc.

Education: B.S. in Construction Management

John has spent over 35 years in construction, managing projects and crews across San Antonio. He takes pride in his work and enjoys mentoring younger workers, but the job has started wearing him down. Lately, he feels winded walking job sites and completely drained by the end of the day.
Outside of work, John enjoys watching football and never misses a Cowboys game. He loves grilling for his family and spending time with his grandkids. Fishing used to be a weekend escape, but work has made it harder to get out on the water. His routine has not helped his health. Most days, he eats fast food for lunch, and his only exercise is walking to job sites. With retirement approaching, he wants to make sure he will be around to enjoy it. However, he hates making reasonless trips to the Doctor and wants to know if he needs to go for sure.

# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve and the focus of this interval of work !!!

## Methods

!!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. Only include research methods in here, not design documents/techniques/artifacts !!!

- [In methods] An explanation of each task and each question in your protocol to describe what you hope to discover from it (i.e. which component of UX does it reveal?)
- [In methods] An explanation of your overall approach to the study (e.g. formative vs summative, think-aloud, etc.)

## Findings

- [In findings] A summary of your data (including overall trends in qualitative and quantitative data
- [In findings] A link to the spreadsheet for data collection, with rows filled out representing the data collected

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

- [In conclusions] The interpretation of your findings, including both (A) recommended changes to improve the user experience and (B) aspects of the design that are affirmed to remain as-is

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!

- [In caveats] A description of limitations to your study or stipulations to the conclusions you made

1. Students were all tech students, and we knew most of the people
2. Mostly males
3.
